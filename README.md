1) Led a significant project in collaboration with Kaggle, applying state-of-the-art deep learning models, including VGG19,
DenseNet201, and ResNet50, for the detection of Diabetic Retinopathy using the APTOS 2019 dataset.
2) Implemented transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models, enhancing Diabetic Retinopathy detection efficiency by
40% and achieving a 25% reduction in false positive rates.
3) Balanced dataset by downsampling majority class to 1000 samples and upsampling minority class to 1000 samples, addressing
biases and enhancing model performance.
4) Engineered a cutting-edge algorithm to optimize model performance by implementing a balanced weighted categorical loss entropy
function, resulting in a 15% reduction in misclassification errors and a 20% improvement in model accuracy.
5) Engaged in ongoing efforts to document findings for journal paper and IEEE conference presentation.
6) Achieved different accuracies for different deep learning models after balancing the dataset such as:
    - DenseNet201: 80%
    - ResNET50: 65%
    - VGG19: 69%
